## Projects
You'll find more information on the project itself, but here's an overview of all projects we worked on during the Hackathon.

- [BC AI Studio](./BCAIStudio/readme.md)
- [Customer Information]("./CustomerCopilot/Readme.md")
- [Translation Copilot](./TranslationCopilot/Readme.md) 
- [Create Reminder Emails](CoPilotReminder\readme.md) 
- Verify Master Data
- [Formula Copilot](CustomerCopilot\Readme.md) 
- [Quote of the Day](QuoteOfTheDay\Readme.md) 

> **Note**: 
All these projects are merely "Proof Of Concepts".  We had ideas, and we wanted to show how in our mind it could work as a Copilot feature in combination with LLM.
