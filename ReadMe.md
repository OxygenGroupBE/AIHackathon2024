## Projects
You'll find more information on the project itself, but here's an overview of all projects we worked on during the Hackathon.

- [BC AI Studio](./BCAIStudio/readme.md)
- [Customer Information Copilot](CustomerCopilot/Readme.md) 
- [Translation Copilot](TranslationCopilot/Readme.md) 
- [Create Reminder Emails](CoPilotReminder/readme.md) 
- [Verify Master Data](VerifyMasterData/readme.md) 
- [Formula Copilot](CoPilotFormulas/readme.md) 
- [Quote of the Day](QuoteOfTheDay\readme.md) 

> **Note**: 
All these projects are merely "Proof Of Concepts".  We had ideas, and we wanted to show how in our mind it could work as a Copilot feature in combination with LLM.
