## Problem Statement
When you select a customer, it might be useful to have some extra information about the customer.  Like payment behavior, or .. .  This info is in the system, but needs some manual short analysis.  It would be nice to have this information available in a fast way.

## Solution Overview
This new module uses copilot to figure out the customer information, and present it in a user friendly way.

Name: Customer Information CoPilot
Main features: understanding customer data, like customer ledger entries, and present it in a user friendly way.

## Accomplishments
Better understanding of how copilot handles different data sources.
Better understanding in how to analyze data (and realizing it's not that easy).

## Impact
You don't need to analyze the data yourself, and you get a user friendly overview of the customer data.

## Project Continuation
Analyzing data is something that many people request, need and expect.  This module doesn't do that.  That's a major flaw, and I hope the in the future we'll be able to (safely) upload data to a (private?) service, so we can prompt that data with copilot.

## Value Proposition
Faster analyzing of customer data.  No setup.  User friendly overview of the data.
