## Problem Statement
Maintaining, checking and supervising Master Data can be a big change within an organisation. Definitely when multiple users are handling it.
Every user can make mistakes or forget to fill up some fields.
In the past a poweruser must check every new or updated record manually. This can be a very time consuming task.

## Solution Overview
Main Features:

Automated data validation and verification processes
User-friendly interface for seamless data entry and management
Real-time notifications for incomplete or erroneous data entries

Benefits:

Streamlined data maintenance process, reducing manual effort and errors
Improved data accuracy and integrity through automated validation
Enhanced efficiency as power users can focus on strategic tasks rather than routine checks
Increased user satisfaction with a smoother and more reliable data management system

## Accomplishments
We achieved to develop a functional prototype, showcasing the core features. It implements automated data validation and verification processes, reducing manual workload. But it needs some more tweaking.

## Impact 
Our solution will save time and effort for users through automation.
Improving data accuracy and integrity.

## Project Continuation
To make this project fully functional we need to finetuning the system prompt to make the data validation and verification proposals more reliabel. 

## Value Proposition 
Our solution help users to make better and complete data and gives powerusers more time to focus on strategic tasks rather than routine checks.
