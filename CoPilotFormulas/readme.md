## Problem Statement
When you need to process calculation formulas in AL it demands extensive develoment. Also, it usually has to be flexible: users tend to change formulas, parameters, ... .

## Solution Overview
This new module uses copilot to figure out the formula, and calculate the result. The module is intended to be an API, for other functionalities to benefit from it.

Main features: understanding formulas, and calculate result by providing parameters with values. 

## Accomplishments
Better understanding of how copilot handles different mathematical expressions.
Conclusion: it's not perfect, but pretty good.  When implemented in a framework, it can be a very usefull tool.

## Impact 
You don't need special development if you formula, parameters changes.
You can easily change parameters, value, formulas, ... 

## Project Continuation
A helpfull thing will be more information of how copilot handles/converts certain mathematical symbols.
Also, it would be helpful to be able to rely on input from the internet, like official indexations and such.  Online copilot can find them, but not what we had available in the product.

## Value Proposition 
Faster calculation of formulas with parameters. Easy setup. Very flexible, configurable formulas: users would be able to change the formula, and it would still work.
