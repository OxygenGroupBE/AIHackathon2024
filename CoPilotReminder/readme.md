## Problem Statement
When you need to send reminders to customers, the mails sound too much the same.  Also, it usually has to be flexible:  the level of severity, the language, ... .

## Solution Overview
Dynamicaly generate reminder texts based on the reminder level input and the customer language. 

Name: Reminder mails with CoPilot

Main features: 
Generate a reminder text based on the customer language and change level of severity

levels:
- first: generates a polite reminder text
- second: generates a stronger reminder text
- last: generates a text with legal clause
  
### Benefits :
You get a draft in a language you don't need to fully understand.
You can easily change the level of severity, and the language.

## Accomplishments
We have a better understanding of the translation capabilities of copilot, which is very powerful and interesting, but delicate.

## Impact 
You get a draft of a transleted reminder that you can send to the customer in the customer his language. If not the language should be English.

## Project Continuation
A guide about how to write prompts for copilot, would be very helpfull.
What are the effect of some words, the order, the.. .  It's not always clear how to write a prompt that will give you the result you want.

It would be nice if we would be able to "train" the model with examples of reminder texts, and the level of severity.

## Value Proposition 
Faster generating unique reminder texts with different tones. 
Easy setup.
